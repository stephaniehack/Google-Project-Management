Example:
Imagine a school district signs a deal with a telehealth company to make sure students don't have to miss school for simple health issues, like fevers or headaches. The deal will be completed by the end of the school year. The students can now interact with the doctor through a tablet, smartphone, or a computer, while they're at school. Implementing this technology into the school's procedures is the project. It's got a clear outcome and start and end date. So, how is that project managed? Well, this project has several tasks, and each one has to be carefully planned out and tracked, or managed, in order for the project to be completed. For example, to start you can organize training sessions for faculty to get them better acquainted with the technology, policies, and procedures. You can budget for tablets, computers, and other vital equipment to facilitate the virtual checkups. You can maintain strong communication with doctors, the telehealth company, and school staff members and so much more. To successfully launch the product in the schools all of those things need to get done.
